# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Deep Learning | Real-World ML Project
In today‚Äôs digital economy, fraud is evolving‚Äîand so should our defense. I developed a machine learning solution to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy, helping financial institutions flag suspicious activities before damage is done.

At first, I implemented traditional models like Random Forest, but while they offered good precision, they missed the subtle patterns hidden in rare fraud cases due to data imbalance.

üîç That‚Äôs when I pivoted.

I integrated a deep learning approach using TensorFlow and Keras, designing a neural network that better captured complex, non-linear relationships in transaction behavior. This significantly improved recall without compromising precision‚Äîa crucial balance in fraud detection.

# üí° Key Highlights:

Tackled extreme class imbalance with advanced techniques like SMOTE and class-weight tuning.

Achieved a solid trade-off between precision (reducing false alarms) and recall (catching actual fraud).

Built interpretable insights using confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and AUC-ROC.

Experimented with threshold tuning to optimize fraud detection thresholds based on business risk tolerance.

This project not only sharpened my skills in model development and evaluation, but also in real-world problem-solving‚Äîunderstanding when to go beyond traditional ML and harness the power of deep learning for smarter, more reliable results.
